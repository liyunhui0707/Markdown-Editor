# Markdown Vault App

A local-first desktop Markdown editor for macOS, built with Electron. Notes are stored as plain `.md` files on disk in a folder you choose — no cloud, no accounts, no hosted backend.

Aimed at developers and tech-savvy note-takers who want their notes as plain `.md` files on disk, edited under their full control.

The setup also integrates with the `mcp-note-ingest` MCP server (installed as a Claude Code plugin from the `workflow-and-MCP-and-plugins` marketplace) that lets AI tools write chat notes directly into the same vault.

> Status: usable for local development and early feedback. Not production-distributed. Inspired by simplified local-first Markdown editor workflows; not an Obsidian replacement.

## Headline guarantees

- **Raw Markdown is the source of truth.** The editor stores notes as plain `.md` files; `getText()` returns the raw Markdown text. The live-styling layer in Write mode is visual decoration only — no HTML is injected, no document is rewritten. Round-trip is at the LF / character level (CodeMirror normalizes line endings internally; exact on-disk byte equality is not promised for CRLF files). This guarantee holds for ALL Write engines, including the Stage A `hybrid-cm6-lp` live-preview engine (which uses `Decoration.replace` for emphasis markers — the document is unchanged; only the visible rendering hides them).
- **Local-first.** Notes live in a folder you choose. No cloud, no accounts, no hosted backend.

cd apps/desktop
npm install
npm run dev
```

See [Getting Started](#getting-started) below for build, test, and engine-selection details.

## Features

- Choose any local folder as a Markdown vault.
- Load `.md` files recursively from the selected vault.
- Create, edit, save, and delete notes.
- Notes are kept as normal Markdown files on disk — no proprietary format.
- Focused editor workspace with a collapsible sidebar (open by default).
- Filter notes by Drafts, My Notes, AI Imports, and AI Sessions — four disjoint rows in the sidebar (every note belongs to exactly one).
- Search by title, body, tags, source, file name, and relative path.
- Lightweight frontmatter parsing for `tags` and `source`.
- Seed a demo vault for local testing and demos.
- Watch the selected vault and refresh when Markdown files change on disk.
- Detect MCP-ingested notes by frontmatter `source` (claude/codex/chatgpt/gemini/ai). Older notes under `Inbox/AI Chats/YYYY/MM/` are still recognized by path for backward compatibility.
- Package a local macOS Electron build for testing.
- Adjustable editor text size with `Cmd/Ctrl + =`, `Cmd/Ctrl + -`, `Cmd/Ctrl + 0` (persists across launches).
- **AI Sessions search (Stage S4)** — when an AI Sessions note is open in Read mode, a sticky toolbar above the transcript provides in-transcript substring search with match counter and prev/next cycling. When the AI Sessions filter is active in the sidebar, the existing search input ALSO runs cross-session content search across every imported session's body; results render below the note list with match-count badges sorted by match count. The cross-session index builds lazily on the first query (with a small "Indexing sessions…" progress banner), is reused for subsequent queries, and is invalidated automatically on vault reload.
- **AI Sessions are read-only (Stage S6)** — opening any session in the AI Sessions filter now renders the transcript directly (no Write / Preview / Read tabs). The tab bar above the editor is hidden for sessions; the right panel shows the rendered transcript only. Non-session notes (Drafts / Vault / AI Imports) keep their existing Write + Preview tabs. Rationale: AI Sessions are immutable transcripts of past conversations — the editing surfaces (CM6 / Toast UI) consume substantial memory on multi-MB transcripts (OOM risk) and were rarely the right tool for log content. If you want to annotate a session, create a separate companion note.
- **Local AI: Summarize & Rewrite** — one-click **Summarize** the active note and one-click **Rewrite** a selection (or whole note) via a configurable local OpenAI-compatible endpoint (LM Studio, Ollama, `llama-server`). Results **stream into a side panel** below the editor token-by-token, stored **per note**: switching away does not lose them, and the × button both dismisses the panel and aborts the in-flight request. The original note body, dirty state, and on-disk file are never modified by either verb. See [Local AI: Summarize & Rewrite](#local-ai-summarize--rewrite) below.
- **AI Sessions favorites + grouped view (Stage S5)** — the AI Sessions filter now renders sessions as a grouped tree: **Favorites** (when any; rendered flat) → **Codex** → **Claude** → **Other**. The three agent groups are bucketed by the session's last-activity time (read from the importer's `source_mtime` frontmatter, falling back to file mtime): Today / Within 3 Days / Older Than 3 Days. Empty buckets are skipped. Click the ☆ on any session row to favorite it (★); favorites persist to `localStorage` and appear in a collapsible Favorites section at the top. Both group headers AND bucket headers collapse/expand on click; their state persists. Session row titles use the importer's `source_custom_title` / `source_ai_title` when present (falls back to the on-disk filename otherwise). Cross-session search results (Stage S4) show the ★ indicator for favorited sessions. Other filters (All / Drafts / Vault / AI Imports) keep their flat list — only AI Sessions gets the grouped view. AI Imports and AI Sessions are disjoint: imported sessions appear only under AI Sessions, not under AI Imports.

### Data-safety guarantees

- Track unsaved state for drafts and vault notes with a visible dirty badge.
- Preserve draft content across note and vault switches — no silent data loss.
- Require vault selection before saving a pre-vault draft (OS folder picker opens automatically).
- Block app quit when unsaved work exists — close-guard dialog with Cancel, Discard & Quit, or Save All & Quit.
- Save All & Quit saves every dirty note and draft in one action before quitting.
- Block duplicate filenames and refuse to overwrite existing vault files on save.

## Editor modes

Each note has two display modes selected by the `Write` and `Preview` tab buttons above the editor (mouse-toggle only — no keyboard shortcut for the toggle).

- **Write mode** — type and edit Markdown source.
- **Preview mode** — Toast UI Editor renders the Markdown read-only.

Four Write engines exist in the codebase. The engine is resolved on load by `apps/desktop/lib/write-engine.js` in the following priority order:

1. URL query parameter: `?writeEngine=<name>`
2. `localStorage` key: `markdownVault.writeEngine = "<name>"`
3. Default: `hybrid-cm6`  (Stage 17; previously `cm6`)

| Engine | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `hybrid-cm6` | **Default** | CodeMirror 6 with an additional live-Markdown decoration layer that styles common syntax in place (see list below). Promoted from experimental to default in Stage 17. Uses `Decoration.mark` only — no widgets, no `Decoration.replace`. |
| `hybrid-cm6-lp` | Experimental (Stages A + B + C + D + E + F + G.1 + G.2, opt-in) | Live-preview variant of `hybrid-cm6`. Reuses the hybrid walker via its public export PLUS adds inline-marker and block-marker plugins. **Stage A covered emphasis** (`*`, `_`, `**`, `__`); **Stage B added inline-code backticks, strikethrough `~~`, inline-link brackets/parens/URL/title, and inline-image markup**. **Stage C is the first stage where lp visibly diverges from `hybrid-cm6`**: inline images (`![alt](url)`) render as actual `<img>` elements inline (off-active-line) via `WidgetType` widgets. URL allowlist (`https:`, `data:image/*`, vault-relative paths) gates what renders; vault-relative paths resolve via a new IPC route (`window.vaultApi.resolveImagePath`) with symlink-safe filesystem reads mirroring the session importer. Disallowed URLs (`http:`, `javascript:`, etc.) show a styled-alt placeholder. **Stage D extends the Decoration.replace + atomic-range pattern from inline markers to three block-level marker categories**: ATX heading prefix (`#` … `######`), list bullets (`-`, `*`, `+`, `1.`, `1)`), and blockquote `>`. Setext underlines + HorizontalRule + TaskMarker + fenced-code fences are explicitly preserved unchanged. The Stage D user-visible payoff is thin (cursor atomicity + DOM-level absence of block markers); the architectural payoff is that subsequent widget stages (E, F, G) can rely on block-marker scope decisions being settled. **Stage E renders GFM tables as actual HTML `<table>` grids off-active** via a new multi-line block `TableWidget`: walks the Lezer Table node, parses GFM alignment from the delimiter row (`:---`/`:---:`/`---:`), builds `<table>/<thead>/<tbody>` via `document.createElement` + `textContent` (XSS-safe; HTML special chars in cells render as escaped text). Cell text rendered as plain text (inline markdown inside cells NOT rendered — deferred). Table-level active resolution: caret on ANY line of the table → widget disappears, walker source returns. **Stage F renders LaTeX math via KaTeX**: inline `$x$` and display `$$x$$` off-active render as real TeX. Detection is regex-based with a Pandoc-style whitespace rule + `\$` escape handling; caller-side Lezer-aware filtering skips matches inside InlineCode / FencedCode / frontmatter. KaTeX vendored to `lib/vendor/katex/`; called with `throwOnError: false` + `trust: false`; invalid TeX produces a styled error placeholder. Stage F is the FIRST lp stage to add a new npm dependency (`katex@^0.16`). **Stage G.1 adds fenced-code syntax highlighting via highlight.js** — a `CodeBlockWidget` walks the Lezer `FencedCode` node, reads the language info, and calls `hljs.highlight` for known languages; unknown / missing-language code blocks fall back to plain text. highlight.js vendored to `lib/vendor/highlight/` (~157 KB minified + atom-one-light theme). **Stage G.2 adds Mermaid diagram rendering** for ` ```mermaid ` fenced blocks — first lp stage with async-render widget. The widget returns a sync placeholder; `mermaid.render()` (Promise) patches in the SVG on resolve. Async safety via a `destroyed` flag (mirrors Stage C's image-widget IPC pattern). Mermaid vendored to `lib/vendor/mermaid/` (~3 MB; `securityLevel: 'strict'`). Lang dispatch in `cm6-lp-block.js`'s FencedCode branch: `mermaid` → MermaidWidget; everything else → Stage G.1 CodeBlockWidget. On-active-line behavior matches `hybrid-cm6` exactly for ALL Stages A–G.2. Opt in via `?writeEngine=hybrid-cm6-lp` or `localStorage.setItem('markdownVault.writeEngine', 'hybrid-cm6-lp')`. Stage H (promote lp to default) remains upcoming. |
| `cm6` | Fallback | CodeMirror 6 single-document adapter — Markdown editing with syntax highlighting, real undo/redo, real selection, Chinese IME support. Reachable via `?writeEngine=cm6` or by setting the `markdownVault.writeEngine` localStorage key to `cm6`. |
| `hybrid` | Legacy fallback | Stage 2 HybridWriteView (per-block textarea swap) plus Toast UI Preview. Retained as a fallback; removal is deferred. |

### Live styling in `hybrid-cm6` (default) and `hybrid-cm6-lp` (Stages A + B + C + D + E + F + G.1 + G.2 opt-in)

The hybrid-cm6 engine emits CSS-class decorations over the existing source text — purely visual, never modifying the document or generating HTML. Raw Markdown is the source of truth; `getText()` returns the raw Markdown source text without rendered HTML or decoration artifacts. (CodeMirror normalizes line endings internally, so source-text round-trip is at the LF / character level, not the exact on-disk byte level for CRLF files.)

**Stage A + B `hybrid-cm6-lp` differs from `hybrid-cm6` for five inline marker categories**: emphasis (`*`, `_`, `**`, `__`), inline code (`` ` ``), strikethrough (`~~`), inline link brackets/parens/URL/title, and inline image markup. The lp engine reuses the hybrid walker via its public export (no duplication) and adds an inline-marker plugin that emits `Decoration.replace` off the active line (the marker characters are removed from the visible DOM) and registers the replaced ranges with `EditorView.atomicRanges` so arrow-key cursor motion steps over each hidden marker as one unit. Link TEXT and image ALT ranges stay visible (link text underlined per existing `cm-md-link-text`; alt text italic+muted per existing `cm-md-image-alt`). On the active line the lp plugin emits nothing — the hybrid walker's existing `Decoration.mark` + existing CSS reveal the marker dimmed exactly as in `hybrid-cm6`. Off-active-line visual appearance is essentially identical between the two engines (both hide the markers); the differences are cursor mechanics (atomic-range stepping over hidden markers) and the architectural foundation for stages C–H. Reference-style links/images, autolinks, and link-reference definitions are intentionally NOT replaced (deferred to a later stage or post-migration polish).

Since Stage 26 the "hide off the active line / reveal on the active line" reveal mechanism that appears in the bullets below actually follows the FULL selection: every line touched by the current selection or any cursor reveals its syntax markers. Single-caret behavior is unchanged. Multi-line drag selections and multi-cursor selections (Alt-click) now show raw markers on every touched line, not just the line containing the primary caret. Currently styled:

- ATX headings `#` … `######`
- Setext headings (`Heading\n=====` and `Heading\n-----`) — reuse the same H1 / H2 typography as ATX; the `===` / `---` underline hides off the active line and reveals dimmed when the caret enters the underline line. **As of Stage 29, touching the title line ALSO reveals the underline** (the construct-reveal plugin propagates a Setext-scoped class to both lines so caret on either reveals the marker). Scoped to Setext only — ATX `#` markers inside a blockquote whose other lines are construct-active do NOT silently reveal
- Bold `**…**` and italic `*…*` / `_…_`
- Inline code `` `…` ``
- Inline links `[text](url)` — underlined link-text. **Clickable in hybrid-cm6**: on macOS, `Cmd-click` on the link text opens the URL via the system default handler (browser for `https:`, mail client for `mailto:`). Place the caret inside the link and press `Cmd-Shift-O` to open from the keyboard. URLs are validated against an allowlist — only `https:` and `mailto:` schemes (case-insensitive) open; everything else, including degenerate forms like `https:` or `mailto:` with no rest, silently no-ops. `Cmd-Shift-click`, `Cmd-Alt-click`, `Cmd-Ctrl-click`, and plain (no-modifier) click do not open and remain normal caret moves. IME composition is never interrupted. Links inside YAML frontmatter do not open. Cross-platform Ctrl-click is deferred. No `<a>` is rendered and no `href` attribute is emitted — the click is routed via preload + main IPC to `shell.openExternal`
- Reference-style links `[text][ref]` and collapsed `[text][]` — same underline as inline links; shortcut references `[shortcut]` are intentionally not styled
- Link definitions `[ref]: url "title"` — entire definition line dimmed
- Inline images `![alt](url)` (with optional title) — alt text rendered italic and muted; `![`, `]`, `(`, URL, optional title, `)` hide off the active line. **No `<img>`, no fetch, no clicks.** Reference-style images `![alt][1]` are intentionally not styled
- List markers (`-`, `*`, `+`, `1.`, `1)`) and blockquote markers (`>`) — dimmed when revealed; hidden off-active and revealed dimmed via three layered mechanisms: (Stage 27) `.cm-activeLine` and Stage 26's `.cm-md-active-range` reveal the marker when the caret or any selection range touches the marker line itself; (Stage 28) for multi-line blockquotes, touching any line of the blockquote also reveals the first-line `>` via the construct-active reveal path; (Stage 30) for multi-line list items, touching any line of the same `ListItem` — including a continuation paragraph — also reveals the first-line list marker via the scoped `.cm-md-list-item-active` reveal path (sibling list items remain hidden when not active). Task-list `[ ]` markers stay dimmed-but-always-visible so the Stage 23 primary-click toggle target is preserved
- Fenced code fences (```` ``` ```` / `~~~`) and the optional language info string — dimmed when revealed; **as of Stage 28, hidden off the active construct and revealed when the active line / selection range touches any line inside the fenced code block**. Multi-line blockquotes also gain construct-level reveal in Stage 28 (touching one line reveals `>` on every line of the quote)
- Horizontal rules (`---`, `***`, `___`) — dimmed and letter-spaced
- GFM tables `| col | col |\n|-----|-----|` — **as of Stage 31 + 32, the cell-separator `|` characters and the `|---|---|` delimiter row hide off the active table and reveal dimmed when the caret/selection touches any line of the table** via a scoped `.cm-md-table-active` reveal path (mirrors the Stage 30 list-item pattern; Stage 28's `.cm-md-construct-active` quote/fence reveal selectors do NOT leak to table interiors and vice versa). **As of Stage 33, tables also get always-visible visual structure**: a light bottom border under the header row and faint alternating background striping on body rows, both rendered whether the caret is in the table or not — so off-active tables still read as tables instead of text-with-spaces. Table header text renders bold via CodeMirror's `defaultHighlightStyle` mapping `tags.heading` on `TableHeader`; **as of Stage 34, the per-character underline that the same mapping adds is suppressed** by a scoped `.cm-md-table-header-line *` rule using `text-decoration-line` so the existing inline-link / autolink / strikethrough semantic decorations inside header cells are preserved. Stage 33's `border-bottom` under the header line is now the single horizontal separator
- Strikethrough `~~…~~` — line-through; `~~` delimiters hide off the active line and reveal dimmed when the caret enters
- Task list markers `[ ]`, `[x]`, `[X]` — dimmed and **interactive in hybrid-cm6**: primary-click on the marker toggles `[ ]` ↔ `[x]` (and `[X]` → `[ ]`). On macOS you can also place the caret on a task line and press **`Cmd-Shift-X`** to toggle (CodeMirror registers this as `Mod-Shift-x`). Toggles are real Markdown edits — they flow through `onChange`, update the dirty badge, participate in undo/redo, and round-trip character-identically after LF normalization on save/reload. Modifier-held clicks and non-primary buttons are no-ops; IME composition is never interrupted
- Autolinks `<https://…>`, `<mailto:…>`, raw `<email@host>`, and bare URLs (`https://example.com`) — underlined; angle brackets share the same hide/reveal mechanism. **Scheme-bearing autolinks `<https://…>` and `<mailto:…>` are clickable on Cmd-click** (same rules as inline links). Raw email autolinks `<foo@example.com>` and bare URLs (not wrapped in `<>` or `[]()`) remain non-clickable — raw email autolinks no-op because the parser exposes the address without a `mailto:` scheme and the URL allowlist rejects schemeless URLs; conversion to `mailto:` is deferred. Reference-style links `[text][ref]` and collapsed `[text][]` are also non-clickable (deferred).
- YAML frontmatter — when a note begins with a strict `---` fence and has a later strict `---` closing fence, the entire region (both fences and the metadata lines between them) renders as plain text. The leading `---` is not styled as a horizontal rule and the closing `---` is not styled as a Setext heading. Detection requires exact `---` on each fence (no `+++`, no trailing whitespace). See Stage 14.9 for details.

Image URLs and link-reference definition URLs are intentionally not autolink-styled.

## Local-first storage

Notes are plain Markdown files in a folder of your choosing. The app does not include cloud sync, accounts, hosted storage, or a remote backend. Drafts created before a vault is selected live in memory until the OS folder picker is used at first save.

Before publishing or sharing the repository, do not commit personal vault content, `.env` files, local MCP config, generated builds, dependency folders, logs, or private assistant/editor settings.

## Tech Stack

- Electron (desktop shell)
- Node.js (renderer + main + tests)
- CodeMirror 6 (`@codemirror/*`) — Write-mode runtime for the default `hybrid-cm6` engine and the `cm6` fallback engine
- `@lezer/markdown` — Markdown parser. The `lib/cm6-entry.js` configuration uses `markdownLanguage` as the base, which already enables the GFM extension set (tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks) plus subscript / superscript / emoji transitively. Only a subset of the parser's nodes is currently styled by the hybrid-cm6 walker — see "Live styling in `hybrid-cm6`" above
- Toast UI Editor (`@toast-ui/editor`) — Preview renderer; also powers the `hybrid` legacy Write engine
- `marked` — Markdown utility
- Node.js built-in test runner
- `mcp-note-ingest` MCP plugin — installed via the `workflow-and-MCP-and-plugins` Claude Code marketplace (see `docs/mcp-ingest-setup.md`)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- macOS
- Node.js
- npm

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm install
```

### Run the desktop app

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run dev
```

Opens the Electron window in development mode. The default Write engine is `hybrid-cm6` (Stage 17). To select a fallback or the Stage A opt-in, set the `markdownVault.writeEngine` localStorage key to `cm6`, `hybrid`, or `hybrid-cm6-lp` in DevTools (`localStorage.setItem('markdownVault.writeEngine', 'cm6')` / `'hybrid'` / `'hybrid-cm6-lp'` — Electron has no normal address bar). The same selection can also be made by loading the window with `?writeEngine=cm6`, `?writeEngine=hybrid`, or `?writeEngine=hybrid-cm6-lp` in its URL.

### Build a local macOS app

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run pack            # unsigned dir build into apps/desktop/dist/
npm run dist:mac        # unsigned zip build for macOS
```

Build artifacts are written to `apps/desktop/dist/` and should not be committed.

### Building renderer bundles

The renderer loads two pre-built IIFE bundles checked into `apps/desktop/lib/`. Rebuild them after changing the corresponding entry file:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run build:cm6       # rebuilds lib/cm6-bundle.js (used by cm6 + hybrid-cm6 + hybrid-cm6-lp engines)
npm run build:editor    # rebuilds lib/toastui-bundle.js (used by Preview + hybrid engine)
```

If you change `lib/cm6-entry.js` or `lib/editor-entry.js` and skip the rebuild, the running app will silently keep using the old bundle.

## Testing

The project uses the Node.js built-in test runner.

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm test                       # full suite (test/, test/spike-cm6/, test/cm6-write-view/, test/session-import/)
npm run test:write-engine      # focused: Write engine resolver
npm run test:cm6-write-view    # focused: CM6 write adapters, hybrid-cm6 decorations, and bundle-entry source contracts
node --test test/session-import/*.test.mjs   # focused: ported Local-Web-Server importers (Stage S1a)
```

MCP smoke test (from the plugin source — clone `markdown-vault-app` if needed):

```bash
cd <markdown-vault-app>/plugins/mcp-note-ingest
npm run smoke
```

## Usage basics

1. Launch the app with `npm run dev`.
2. Choose a local folder as a vault when prompted (or seed a demo vault from the empty state).
3. Press `Cmd+N` for a new note, type in Write mode, press `Cmd+S` to save.
4. Switch to Preview by clicking the `Preview` tab; switch back with `Write`.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + N` | Create new note |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + S` | Save current note |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + =` (or `+`) | Increase editor text size |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + -` | Decrease editor text size |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + 0` | Reset editor text size to default (18px) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` / `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` | Undo / redo in CM6 Write mode |
| `Cmd + Shift + O` | Open the external link at the caret (macOS, hybrid-cm6 Write mode; CodeMirror binding `Mod-Shift-o`) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + D` | Translate the selected word in context via the local Dictionary macOS app (see [Dictionary lookup](#dictionary-lookup)) |
| `Arrow Up` / `Arrow Down` | Navigate note list (when focus is outside text inputs) |
| `Enter` | (Stage S4) In the in-transcript search input — jump to next match |
| `Shift + Enter` | (Stage S4) In the in-transcript search input — jump to previous match |
| `Escape` | (Stage S4) In the in-transcript search input — clear the query and remove highlights |
| `Enter` / `Space` | (Stage S5) On a focused AI Sessions star button — toggle favorite; on a focused group header — collapse / expand the group |

The Write/Preview toggle is mouse-only — there is currently no global keyboard shortcut for it.

## Local AI: Summarize & Rewrite

Two one-click AI actions against a local OpenAI-compatible model — **Summarize** the active note, or **Rewrite** a selected passage (or the whole note) for clarity and concision. The app sends the active note's Markdown body (or your selection, for Rewrite) to the configured endpoint, **streams the response back token-by-token**, and shows it in the same side panel below the editor. By default the endpoint must be a **loopback** address (`localhost` / `127.x` / `::1`), so nothing leaves your machine; pointing at a remote server requires an explicit opt-in (see [Remote endpoints & privacy](#remote-endpoints--privacy) below).

- The original note's body, file on disk, and dirty state are **never** modified by either verb. Copy/paste the result manually if you want to use it.
- Each note has its own result state, shared between Summarize and Rewrite (most recent action wins). Switching to another note mid-flight does not show a stale result; returning to a note while it is still streaming restores the accumulated text so far.
- The × button on the panel **aborts the in-flight request** (cross-process cancel — the model server stops getting new HTTP reads) AND dismisses the current note's result. Buttons re-enable immediately so you can start a fresh request without waiting.
- If the local server is unreachable, the panel shows a friendly inline error and the app stays interactive.

### Rewrite — selection vs. whole note

When you click **Rewrite**:

- If you have a non-empty selection in the editor (Write mode, CM6 engine), Rewrite operates on **just that selection**.
- Otherwise (no selection, or you're in Preview/Read mode, or the active note is an AI Session / read-only note), Rewrite falls back to the **whole note body**.

This protects against rewriting text you cannot see: a stale CM6 selection from a previous note never leaks into the request.

### Setup

1. Start a local OpenAI-compatible server. Examples:
   - **LM Studio** → Server tab → Start. Default endpoint: `http://localhost:1234`. Load any text model.
   - **Ollama** → `ollama serve` (the OpenAI-compatible path lives under `:11434/v1`). Pull a model first, e.g. `ollama pull llama3.1`.
   - **llama.cpp `llama-server`** or any other OpenAI-compatible local server.
2. Launch the editor: `cd apps/desktop && npm run dev`.
3. Open a Markdown note and click **Summarize** or **Rewrite** in the toolbar.

### Configuration

AI settings apply to **both** Summarize and Rewrite. The endpoint URL, model, and remote-allow toggle can be edited in the in-app **AI Settings** panel (see below); the remaining tuning knobs are environment variables. Precedence per setting is **environment variable > saved panel value > built-in default** — an env var, when present, always wins, and the matching panel field is shown locked.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MARKDOWN_AI_PROVIDER` | `openai-compatible` | Adapter selector. `openai-compatible` (default — LM Studio, Ollama's `/v1`, `llama-server`, any OpenAI-compatible server) or `ollama` (Ollama's **native** API — set `MARKDOWN_AI_BASE_URL` to the `:11434` root, **no `/v1`**). Both adapters support Summarize, Rewrite, streaming, and the Test-connection model list. |
| `MARKDOWN_AI_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | Must be `http://` or `https://`. A trailing slash is normalized away. Must be **loopback** unless `MARKDOWN_AI_ALLOW_REMOTE=true` (see below). |
| `MARKDOWN_AI_ALLOW_REMOTE` | _unset_ (treated as `false`) | Gate for non-loopback endpoints. By default a base URL that isn't `localhost` / `127.x` / `::1` is rejected before any network call (reason `remote-blocked`). Set to `true` (case-insensitive) to permit a remote/LAN endpoint; a **Remote AI** badge then appears in the toolbar. |
| `MARKDOWN_AI_MODEL` | `local-model` | LM Studio routes to the currently-loaded model regardless of name. Ollama requires the real model id (e.g. `llama3.1`). |
| `MARKDOWN_AI_TEMPERATURE` | `0.2` | |
| `MARKDOWN_AI_MAX_TOKENS` | `1024` | Bump higher for reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, Gemma-thinking, etc.) whose `reasoning_content` eats the token budget before any visible content appears. |
| `MARKDOWN_AI_TIMEOUT_MS` | `60000` | IPC-handler timeout. The handler resolves with reason `'timeout'` even if the model adapter hangs. |
| `MARKDOWN_AI_MAX_INPUT_CHARS` | `48000` | Notes larger than this are rejected without a network call. |
| `MARKDOWN_AI_STREAMING` | _unset_ (treated as on) | Streaming is on by default. Set to `false` (case-insensitive) to opt out: the panel will show `Summarizing…` / `Rewriting…` for the full duration, then the final reply in one shot. Use this if a specific local server doesn't speak SSE cleanly. Stall timeout still applies via `MARKDOWN_AI_TIMEOUT_MS` — in streaming mode the timer resets on every token (per-chunk stall), not over the whole response. |

Example: point at Ollama via its OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
MARKDOWN_AI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1 \
MARKDOWN_AI_MODEL=llama3.1 \
  npm run dev
```

Example: use Ollama's **native** adapter instead (note the `:11434` root with no `/v1`):

```bash
cd apps/desktop
MARKDOWN_AI_PROVIDER=ollama \
MARKDOWN_AI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434 \
MARKDOWN_AI_MODEL=llama3.1 \
  npm run dev
```

### Settings panel

Click **AI Settings** in the toolbar to edit the most common settings without a terminal:

- **Server URL** — the OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`baseUrl`).
- **Model** — the model id.
- **Allow a remote (off-machine) server** — the privacy opt-in (see below).

**Test connection** pings the endpoint's `/models` (respecting the loopback/allow-remote gate) and reports *"Connected — N models available"* or a friendly error. On success the **Model** field becomes a pick-from-list (a dropdown populated from the server's models; free-typing still works). The test uses the values currently in the panel, so you can verify a URL before saving.

Saved values persist to `ai-settings.json` in Electron's app-data directory and survive restarts. Changes take effect **immediately** — no relaunch — including the **Remote AI** badge, which updates live when you toggle allow-remote or change the URL. If a setting is controlled by an environment variable, its field is shown **disabled** with a hint, because the env var takes precedence. The tuning knobs (temperature, max tokens, timeout, max input chars, streaming, provider) remain environment-only for now.

### Remote endpoints & privacy

By default the AI verbs only talk to a **loopback** endpoint — `localhost`, any `127.x.x.x`, or `::1`. This keeps note content on your machine. A non-loopback `MARKDOWN_AI_BASE_URL` (a LAN IP, a hostname, a public server) is **rejected before any network call** with the typed reason `remote-blocked`; the panel shows _"Remote AI server blocked. Set MARKDOWN_AI_ALLOW_REMOTE=true to allow."_

To send notes to a non-loopback server, set `MARKDOWN_AI_ALLOW_REMOTE=true`. When a remote endpoint is both configured **and** allowed, a **Remote AI** badge appears next to the AI buttons in the toolbar (its tooltip shows the destination hostname) so you always know note content is leaving your machine. The badge stays hidden for loopback endpoints and whenever the allow flag is off.

### Constraints (this stage)

- Streaming is over plain text — the rendered panel is `textContent` only, so any Markdown the model emits is shown verbatim rather than re-rendered as headings / bold / etc.
- No retrieval-augmented generation (RAG); only the active note's body (or the selected passage for Rewrite) is sent.
- No auto-editing of the original note for either verb. The panel is read-only; copy/paste manually if you want to use the result.
- The × button aborts the in-flight HTTP request from this app's side, but whether the local model server actually stops generating depends on the server. LM Studio's `llama.cpp` backend, for example, continues to finish a scheduled response even after the client disconnects — the app re-enables the buttons immediately either way, but you may notice the model server keeps working in the background.
- Most-recent-action wins on the same note: running Summarize after Rewrite (or vice versa) overwrites the previous result. There is no separate history per verb in this stage.
- Selection-aware Summarize is not implemented; Summarize always sends the whole note.
- The in-app settings panel covers the endpoint URL, model, and remote-allow toggle only; the other tuning knobs (temperature, max tokens, timeout, max input chars, streaming, provider) remain environment-variable only.
- No retries, no provider failover, no multi-provider concurrency.
- Failure modes return one of a fixed set of typed reasons (`empty-input`, `input-too-large`, `server-unreachable`, `timeout`, `http-error`, `invalid-response`, `provider-error`, `unknown`) with canned, sanitized user-facing messages. Provider-supplied error text is **not** echoed to the UI.

## Dictionary lookup

`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + D` translates the currently-selected word using the local
[Dictionary macOS app](https://github.com/) (a separate menu-bar app). The app
captures your selection plus the surrounding paragraph so the translation is
context-aware (e.g. "bank" as a riverbank vs. a financial institution), then
shows its own popup with the result.

This is optional and requires the Dictionary app to be installed and running:

- The Dictionary app runs a loopback HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:49152` and writes
  a bearer token to `~/Library/Application Support/DictionaryApp/token` (mode
  `0600`). This app reads that token in the **main process** and POSTs the
  selection there — never over the network, never from the renderer (a renderer
  fetch to `127.0.0.1` would be CORS-blocked).
- If the Dictionary app is not running, or the token is missing, pressing
  `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + D` shows a short status message in the bottom-right pill
  instead of translating. No note content is ever modified.

If you do not use the Dictionary app, simply ignore this shortcut — it has no
effect on normal editing.

## MCP Note Ingestion

The `mcp-note-ingest` MCP server is installed as a Claude Code plugin via the `workflow-and-MCP-and-plugins` marketplace. Source for the plugin lives in this repo at `plugins/mcp-note-ingest/`.

The main tool is:

```text
ingest_chat_markdown
```

It writes Markdown files directly into a fixed local Inbox folder, by default:

```text
/Users/liyunhui/Liyunhui/Inbox/
```

The target can be overridden at server-launch time via the `MCP_INGEST_TARGET_DIR` environment variable. See `docs/mcp-ingest-setup.md` for setup details.

## Developer notes

- **CM6 spike artifacts** — `apps/desktop/spike/` and `apps/desktop/lib/spike-cm6-*` remain in the tree for spike reproducibility (`npm run spike:cm6`, `npm run test:spike-cm6`). They are not consumed by the production app at runtime. Cleanup is deferred.
- **Session import (developer preview, Stage S1a)** — two CLI scripts under `apps/desktop/tools/session-import/` import Claude Code (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/<uuid>.jsonl`) and Codex CLI (`~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-…<uuid>.jsonl`) session transcripts into markdown files under `~/agent-sessions/<agent>/`. Run from `apps/desktop/`:

  ```bash
  npm run session-import:claude   # imports ~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl
  npm run session-import:codex    # imports ~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl
  SESSION_ROOT=/some/other/dir npm run session-import:claude   # override output root
  SESSION_IMPORT_MAX_BYTES=1048576 npm run session-import:claude   # override 50 MB cap
  ```

  The output is a faithful port of `Local-Web-Server/tools/import-{claude,codex}.js` — byte-for-byte parity with upstream output except for a single inserted `source: claude` / `source: codex` line added immediately after `agent:` (so the existing AI Imports filter recognizes the imported notes). Security guarantees mirror upstream verbatim: `O_NOFOLLOW` open, post-open dev/ino TOCTOU check, ancestor-symlink rejection on the output chain, `0o600` files / `0o700` directories, atomic tmp+rename with 5× `EEXIST` retry. No UI integration at this stage; the right-side AI Imports panel is deferred to Stage S2.

- **AI Sessions search (Stage S4)** — port of `Local-Web-Server/public/search-utils.js` into the desktop renderer. Split into three IIFE-wrapped modules under `apps/desktop/lib/session-viewer/` to stay under the project's 300-LOC cap:
  - `search-dom.js` — pure DOM walk that wraps matches in `<mark>` via `createElement` + `createTextNode` (never `innerHTML`); clears highlights by coalescing sibling text nodes; flips an `mark--active` class to mark the currently-focused result.
  - `search-index.js` — lazy in-memory index over imported session bodies. `buildGlobalIndex` runs with bounded concurrency; `searchIndex` returns `{id, title, mtime, matchCount}` rows sorted by match count then mtime; `MIN_GLOBAL_QUERY_LEN = 2`.
  - `in-file-search-toolbar.js` — headless controller for the Read-mode toolbar. Input → walk + counter; prev/next → cycle + scroll-into-view; Enter / Shift+Enter mirror the buttons; Escape clears.

  Index lifecycle (in `apps/desktop/index.html`) holds two invariants:
  - Single-flight: a `pendingCrossSessionIndexBuild` promise is reused across rapid keystrokes so two input events never kick two builds.
  - Generation-stamped: `currentNotesGeneration` bumps on every successful `loadVaultNotes`; the index records its build-time generation in its `.then()`, and a post-await guard forces a rebuild on any mismatch so a mid-build vault refresh can't yield stale results. The index is also reset on `stopWatchingVault`.

  Outgoing edits are preserved across cross-session result clicks via a shared `selectNote(noteId)` helper that runs `liveEditorInstance.exitWriteMode()` + `bodyForRead(outgoingNote)` BEFORE reassigning `selectedNoteId` — the same flush path the note-list row click uses, so the cross-session jump is data-safe.

- **AI Sessions favorites + grouping (Stage S5)** — port of `Local-Web-Server/public/grouping.js` (verbatim) + the favorites helpers from `view-state.js` lines 76–124. Three IIFE-wrapped modules under `apps/desktop/lib/session-viewer/`:
  - `favorites.js` — `createFavoritesController({ storage, key })` returning `{ isFavorite, toggle, getAll, clear, size }`. Pure helpers (`loadFavoritesFromStorage`, `saveFavoritesToStorage`, `toggleFavorite`) remain on the api for direct testing. localStorage key is namespaced as `markdownVault.aiSessions.favorites`.
  - `grouping.js` — `groupAndSort(items, { sort, today, isFavorite })` returning `{ favorite?, codex, claude, other, counts }`. `LAYER_ORDER` is `today / w3 / older` (3-layer scheme — simplified from upstream's 5-layer based on round-2 user feedback). `localEpochDay` is timezone-aware. The editor's port bucketizes **all** agent groups including `other` (uniform tree shape; intentional divergence from upstream which leaves `other` flat). The Favorites overlay is rendered flat (not bucketed) so starred sessions are reachable in one glance.
  - `grouped-list-renderer.js` — headless renderer. Builds collapsible group + bucket + row DOM via `createElement` + `createTextNode` (no `innerHTML`). Star-click handlers call `stopPropagation` so toggling a row's star doesn't also fire the row's selection click. Group-header collapse state is stored in a renderer-injected `isCollapsed` callback so the caller owns persistence.

  The grouped tree replaces the flat AI Sessions list only when `currentFilter === 'sessions'`; all other filters keep the existing flat-list code path unchanged. Notes are adapted into the grouping item shape via an in-renderer `notesToSessionItems(notes)` + `relPathToAgent(relativePath)` pair (the agent prefix rules mirror `sessions-filter.js`).

## Project status & maturity

**What works**

- Local vault workflow: choose any folder, load `.md` files recursively, create / edit / save / delete notes.
- Save / load round-trip preserves raw Markdown source.
- Dirty-state tracking and close-guard dialog (Cancel / Discard & Quit / Save All & Quit) protect unsaved work.
- Live-styled Write mode under the default `hybrid-cm6` engine; Preview mode via Toast UI Editor.
- All four engines (`hybrid-cm6` default, `hybrid-cm6-lp` Stage A opt-in, `cm6` fallback, `hybrid` legacy fallback) selectable via URL query or `markdownVault.writeEngine` localStorage key.
- MCP ingest writes AI-chat notes into a fixed local Inbox folder (default `/Users/liyunhui/Liyunhui/Inbox/`; overridable via `MCP_INGEST_TARGET_DIR`).
- Stage 18 stabilization QA passed — clean Branch A closure (see `docs/test-manual.md` Stage 18 section).
- Automated test suite at `tests 907, pass 905, skipped 2, fail 0` (`npm test`); perf opt-in suite at `5 / 5 / 0 / 0` (`npm run test:perf`).

**What's still evolving**

- Screenshots not yet captured (planned paths listed above under "Screenshots").
- Packaging is currently macOS-only.
- No code-signing guidance yet.
- Broader release polish (issue-reporting pointer, additional `docs/assets/` artifacts).

**What's not supported**

- No clickable links / autolinks in Write mode (they render as visual underline only).
- No real image preview in Write mode (`![alt](url)` shows styled alt text; no image is fetched).
- No interactive task checkboxes (`[ ]` / `[x]` are dimmed but not clickable).
- No full table rendering in Write mode — tables work in Preview only.
- No math syntax (`$x$`, `$$…$$`).
- No footnote support.
- No cross-platform packaging.
- No sync, no accounts, no hosted backend.
- Not a WYSIWYG editor.

**How to run tests** — see the [Testing](#testing) section.

## Known limitations

- The packaged build workflow is currently macOS-focused.
- No built-in sync across devices.
- No account system or hosted backend.
- No plugin system, graph view, or backlinks UI.
- Not a WYSIWYG editor. Write mode always edits Markdown source — `hybrid-cm6` adds visual decorations on top, it does not replace the source with a rendered view.
- Write mode does not currently support:
  - Full table rendering (the GFM `Table` parser nodes exist but are not styled by hybrid-cm6 — pipes stay raw; switch to Preview for table rendering).
  - Math syntax (`$x$`, `$$…$$`) — no parser or renderer.
  - Footnotes (`[^1]` and `[^1]: …`) — no parser support.
  - Real image preview (`![alt](url)` shows alt text styled but does not load the image).
  - Clickable links / autolinks (text is underlined but never navigates).
  - Interactive task checkboxes (`[ ]` / `[x]` are dimmed but not toggled by clicking).
- The `hybrid-cm6` engine became the default in Stage 17. The plain `cm6` adapter and the legacy `hybrid` engine remain available as fallbacks via `?writeEngine=cm6` / `?writeEngine=hybrid` or by setting the `markdownVault.writeEngine` localStorage key to the matching value. Users who had the `markdownVault.writeEngine` localStorage key set to `"cm6"` before Stage 17 continue to get `cm6`.
- The app is intended for local testing and early feedback, not production distribution.
- **Local AI: Summarize & Rewrite** is intentionally narrow this stage: streaming + abort ship, but the rendered output is plain `textContent` (no Markdown re-rendering), there is no RAG, no auto-edit of the original note, an in-app settings panel for the endpoint/model/allow-remote (other tuning knobs remain env-var only), no retries, no provider failover, no per-verb history per note, and whether the upstream model server actually stops on × depends on the server. See the [Local AI: Summarize & Rewrite](#local-ai-summarize--rewrite) section for the full constraint list.

### Deferred items

- Hybrid editor removal (`hybrid-cm6` is the default; both `cm6` and legacy `hybrid` remain as fallbacks).
- CodeMirror 6 spike code cleanup.
- Claude Design prototype.
- Auto-save.
- Multi-window support.

## Roadmap / future work

Not committed to dates. Items listed roughly in priority order:

- ~~Hybrid-cm6 default-readiness sequence~~ — completed in Stage 17. `hybrid-cm6` is now the default Write engine; `cm6` and legacy `hybrid` remain selectable fallbacks.
- **Obsidian-style Live Preview migration** — Stages A, B, C, D, E, F, G.1, and G.2 done. Stages A + B introduced `Decoration.replace`-based hiding + atomic-range cursor motion for emphasis, inline code, strikethrough, inline link markers, and inline image markup. **Stage C is the first stage where lp visibly diverges from `hybrid-cm6`**: actual `<img>` elements render inline for inline images, with URL/path security allowlist (`https:`, `data:image/*`, vault-relative resolved via new IPC route) + symlink-safe filesystem reads mirroring the session importer. **Stage D extends the Decoration.replace + atomic-range pattern from inline markers to three block-level marker categories** (ATX heading prefix, list bullets, blockquote `>`). HorizontalRule, Setext underlines, TaskMarker, and fenced-code fences preserved. **Stage E renders GFM tables as actual HTML `<table>` grids off-active** via a multi-line block `TableWidget` (XSS-safe via `textContent`; per-column GFM alignment; cell text rendered as plain text — inline markdown inside cells deferred). Table-level active resolution: caret on ANY line in the table → widget swaps back to walker-styled Markdown source. **Stage F adds KaTeX math rendering** for inline `$x$` and display `$$x$$` via a regex-based detector (Pandoc whitespace rule + `\$` escape) with Lezer-aware filtering (math inside InlineCode/FencedCode/frontmatter NOT rendered). KaTeX vendored to `lib/vendor/katex/`; invalid TeX produces a styled error placeholder via `throwOnError: false` + try/catch. First lp stage to add an npm dependency (`katex@^0.16`). **Stage G.1 adds fenced-code syntax highlighting** via highlight.js (Lezer-native FencedCode detection — no regex layer; whole-block active resolution; known languages get `hljs.highlight`, unknown languages fall back to plain text). **Stage G.2 adds Mermaid diagram rendering** for ` ```mermaid ` blocks — first async-render widget (sync placeholder + Promise-resolve patches SVG; destroyed-flag prevents stale DOM updates). Mermaid vendored to `lib/vendor/mermaid/` (~3 MB). Stage H (promotion to default) remains upcoming. See `docs/stage-history.md` Stages A + B + C + D + E + F + G.1 + G.2 rows for full implementation summaries.
- Add screenshots and a polished release checklist.
- Broaden automated coverage for vault file operations.
- Improve metadata editing UX (current frontmatter handling is read-only beyond tags / source).
- Expand packaging and signing guidance.
- Optional further hybrid-cm6 live-styling coverage: hard line breaks (two-space EOL / `\`), HTML block / tag dimming. (GFM table delimiter dimming shipped in Stages 31 + 32.) None are blockers for current usage.

```

The `hybrid-cm6` walker is intentionally limited to `Decoration.mark` over the existing source — no widgets, no `Decoration.replace`, no document mutation, no HTML generation. The Stage A `hybrid-cm6-lp` engine relaxes this for emphasis markers only (uses `Decoration.replace` + `WidgetType` widgets to hide off-active markers and registers them with `EditorView.atomicRanges` for atomic cursor motion) while preserving the source-of-truth invariant: the document is never mutated. Source text is the source of truth in BOTH engines; decorations are visual only.

## Contributing

Small, reviewable changes are preferred. The project follows a TDD-first workflow for production changes:

1. Inspect the current code and existing tests before editing.
2. Add or update a focused test that pins the new behavior.
3. Make the smallest implementation change that turns it green.
4. Run the focused suite and the full `npm test` before opening a PR.
5. Update `docs/test-manual.md` if user-facing behavior changes.

See `CLAUDE.md` for the project rules followed when collaborating with AI coding assistants.
